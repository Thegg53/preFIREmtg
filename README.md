## Running Locally

The site is plain HTML + JS with no build step, but you can't open the HTML files directly from the filesystem (`file://`) because browsers block ES module imports and `fetch()` calls cross-origin. You need a local HTTP server.

### Option 1 — VS Code + Live Server (recommended, auto-reload on save)
1. Install the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension in VS Code.
2. Right-click `index.html` in the Explorer panel → **Open with Live Server**.
3. The site opens at `http://127.0.0.1:5500` and automatically reloads when you save a file.

### Option 2 — Python (no install needed on macOS/Linux)
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```
Then open http://localhost:8080

### Option 3 — Node.js (no global install needed)
```bash
npx serve .
```
Then open the URL printed in the terminal (usually http://localhost:3000).
